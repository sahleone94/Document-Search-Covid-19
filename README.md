## Project Motivation
With the current Covid-19 pandemic, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) was announced on Kaggle. The dataset contains a corpus of 200,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and other related coronaviruses. Which they have a problem sifting through.
Therefore, I implemented different methods to sift through the articles.  
Keyword Search, Cosine Similarity and Topic Modeling 

## File Descriptions
The functions are located in the Sifting Through Covid-19 Articles.ipynb.

## Results Summary 
Implemented  Keyword Search and Cosine Similarity functions and Topic Modeling to sift through the data COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)
